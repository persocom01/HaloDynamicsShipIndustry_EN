HWI_TurbocannonL,WEAPON,"This energy weapon charges its turbine upon firing, increasing its rate of fire. It boasts extremely long range and is therefore typically used to project suppressive fire.

The turbo cannon was developed from a type of alien rapid-fire weapon. Despite various efforts by the Arms Industry, they have been unable to increase its power through scaling up its projectiles, and this remains the sole limiting factor on the weapon's terrifying potential. However, Arms Industry has successfully designed a compatible weapon slot tailored for turbo weapons, which further stabilizes their projectiles and effectively increases their range.

HWI_Duality,WEAPON,"The Duality combined flak-and-missile point defense system is based on an older design. While flak cannons are generally sufficient for most threats, they fall short against heavy fighters. Integrating anti-fighter missiles extends the Duality's defensive reach, but its high maintenance demands limit widespread deployment.",,,,
HWI_POS_Pod,WEAPON,This weapon uses unknown principles to generate energy clusters that display a measure of intelligence. These clusters orbit the point of emission comes within range.,"- ""At least they're obedient, aren't they?""",,,
HWI_Stella,WEAPON,"The Starstream-DEM is a special variant of the standard DEM. Utilizing Halo Dynamics' technology, a highly dense material source is compressed into the warhead. This disperses into a debris stream upon impact, causing damage. While these fragments pose little threat to conventional armor, they generate massive interference and are capable of disabling various systems.",,,,
HWI_Stella_Fighter,WEAPON,"The Starstream-DEM is a special variant of the standard DEM. Utilizing Halo Dynamics' technology, a highly dense material source is compressed into the warhead. This disperses into a debris stream upon impact, causing damage.

While these fragments pose little threat to conventional armor, they generate massive interference and are capable of disabling various systems.",,,,
HWI_AntiAromr,WEAPON,"The Resonator emits a jet that interferes with the resonance frequency of armor, reducing its effectiveness. Due to the limited energy of the jet, it is more difficult to prevent targets regaining their original frequency the larger they are, though the impact on armor performance is largely unaffected.",,,,
HWI_Disruptor,WEAPON,"The Disruptor deploys a type of nanomachine that attacks energy circuits. Since it avoids attacking core components, the attack is difficult for automated repair systems to immediately detect. The Department of Science and Technology has written complex control programs that cause these machines to prioritize command channels, resulting in loss of control over shields and tactical systems for the target.",,,,
HWI_Wingman,WEAPON,"A product of the ""Autonomous Threat Interception Program"", this air defense system departs from the previous model based on conventional strikes, and instead uses shield drones that automatically identify and intercept threats. These drones can intercept not only conventional missiles, but also beams and projectiles — at the cost of being expensive to produce and maintain.",,,,
HWI_FirstMantitude,WEAPON,"A device that emits a focused stream of matter with unknown technology. Technical officers have no understanding of how it works, but what is certain is this: the device converts energy into matter, concentrates it at the end of the jet, then compresses, ignites, burns, and detonates it within an extremely short time and in a manner that defies known physics. The process exhibits stellar characteristics and remains remarkably consistent across all tests. The only problem is that the amount of matter involved should be nowhere near enough to produce these effects. The operations chief who observed the entire test thought it was akin to magic.","- ""I plan to give you a star. A star like no other.""",,,
HWI_ConquerorCannon,WEAPON,"The heavy turbo cannon built into the Promise-class and Oath-class is directly connected to their reactors, channeling a portion of flux energy into the plasma projectile, enhancing its power while also assisting both classes of ships in dissipating flux.",,,,
HWI_Counter,WEAPON,"A heavy point defense weapon that fires highly compressed plasma, the Counter is designed to defend against heavy fighters and dense missile waves. It can instantly clear wide swaths of hostiles. The plasma's frequency is pre-tuned at launch, ensuring it detonates at the intended moment, assuming that there is no interference.",,,,
HWI_HammerOfHumanity,WEAPON,"This giant reactor-linked cannon built into the spine of the Twilight class is capable of delivering devastating strikes to any target. Originally designed for use against large, immobile targets, the Twilight-class was envisioned as a fast siege ship. However, with the commissioning of the Starstream-class, the Twilight-class was redesigned as a maneuverable siege cruiser, and the Department of Science and Technology also succeeded in developing a kind of guidance system for the Hammer of Humanity.",,,,
HWI_Apocalypse,WEAPON,"A fast firing warship grade autocannon. While adequate for suppressing and destroying most targets in ground combat situations where the Apocalypse-class is typically deployed, it is not very effective on armored targets.",,,,
HSI_Apocalypse_LA,WEAPON,"Throws a common canister cannon shell as a grenade. This cheap and reliable explosive requires only minimal components and is highly effective in situations where explosive firepower is needed.",,,,
HWI_Bury,WEAPON,"An anti-air weapon designed for small vehicles. Efficient, precise, and extremely compact, but its limited firepower restricts its effectiveness on larger platforms.",,,,

HWI_FocusLance,WEAPON,"An unusual focusing design that synchronizes with enemy shield frequencies during continuous firing, allowing it to bypass part of their protection and rip through any defenses with terrifying power. The Department of War has high praise for the weapon's effectiveness — a rare endorsement for a Department of Science and Technology design. Many believe its prototype was derived from the infamous Dragonfire DEM, though the Department of Science and Technology has never made a statement on this.",,,,
HWI_FlakTF,WEAPON,"Based on the widely Flak Cannon, this weapon has undergone minor modifications to accommodate fire high-powered munitions. However, to maintain the cost-effectiveness of the weapon, its ammunition is designed for timed detonation, avoiding the need for a more complex ammunition forge.",,,,

HSI_DancingButterFly,WEAPON,[REDACTED],,,,
HWI_Crosswind,WEAPON,"Although ship designers argued that missiles launchers should deliver bursts of damage to quickly destroy enemies, a significant number of captains maintained that what they truly needed was a missile system capable of sustained close-range suppression — not a rapidly depleted rocket pod like the Annihilator. To meet this need, the Crosswind, equipped with an advanced targeting system, was developed. Once locked on, the Crosswind can maintain pressure on a target over extended engagements.",,,,
HWI_IonLance,WEAPON,"A miniaturized version of the Tachyon Lance. Although not particularly powerful, the high amount of disruption it causes on hit has made it a favorite among captains of smaller vessels.",,,,

HWI_autopulse,WEAPON,"Numerous built-in capacitors are at the core of this extremely efficient, yet potent energy weapon. Modifications by the Weapons Industry give it additional effects.",,,,
HWI_Ragnarok,WEAPON,"A large energy weapon with great power but limited ammo. Its immense firepower comes from preloaded antimatter munitions stored in heavily fortified ammunition racks. As the nature of the ammo makes it nearly impossible to reload effectively in combat, designers opted to remove the resupply system and instead incorporate a larger ammo rack to extend sustained fire capability. This weapon is typically mounted on small ships with oversized hardpoints due to its limited ammo and range.",,,,
HWI_Fireworks_Fighter,WEAPON,"A fast, light torpedo that provides reliable long-range firepower to a wide range of Halo Dynamics torpedo ships. The Firework boasts excellent range, speed, and ammo capacity, at the cost of a modest increase in space requirements..",,,,
HWI_Standard,WEAPON,"This agile anti-fighter is the same as those used by the Duality, and is capable of intercepting a wide range of small targets.",,,,

HWI_plasma,WEAPON,"A large, arcane weapon that's one of the most devastating sustained damage-dealers in the Sector, provided the ship it's mounted on can handle the flux it generates.",,,,
HWI_hil,WEAPON,"A long-range, high damage beam weapon, often mounted on support ships, or ships that need anti-armor capability on a budget.",,,,
HWI_tachyonlance,WEAPON,"A burst operated beam that delivers a devastating amount of damage with a cascading EMP component. The EMP arcs have a chance to pass through shields based on the target's hard flux level. Modifications by the Weapons Industry make it compatible with Meltdown Protocol.",,,,
HWI_phasebeam,WEAPON,"A short-range, short-duration beam that causes heavy damage in a burst. Capable against armor, as far as beam weapons go.",,,,
HWI_heavyblaster,WEAPON,"Fires bolts of energy at enemies. With high damage and flux costs, the heavy blaster is one of the most damaging weapons for its size. Modifications by the Weapons Industry reduce the flux load of the weapon but also reduce its power. Minimizing the buffer energy conduits also decrease its flux costs.",,,,
HWI_gravitonbeam,WEAPON,"An atypical beam weapon that is highly effective versus shields, destabilizing them and increasing damage dealt from all sources. Excellent range, but the damage per second ratio vs armor is sub-par. Modifications by the Weapons Industry were contrained by its operating principles, and are so small they have been jokingly called a paintjob.",,,,
HWI_ionbeam,WEAPON,"A long-range support weapon, the Ion Beam is able to fire more and more disruptive EMP arcs through shields as the target's hard flux levels go up - at a hefty flux cost for the firing ship. Modifications by the Weapons Industry make it compatible with Meltdown Protocol.",,,,
HWI_mininglaser,WEAPON,"Cheap utility laser hardwired for missile and fighter defense. Long-ranged, but hampered by its low power output.",,,,
HWI_heavyac,WEAPON,"A triple-barreled cannon that fires a burst of standardized shells at medium range. It is most effective versus enemy shields. Modifications by the Weapons Industry have modified the automatic feeding and recoil systems, resulting in an unexpected reduction in recoil.",,,,

It serves as a mobile fire support point in Halo Dynamics' ground operations.",,,,
HSI_Arbaletrier_R,WEAPON,A small pulse weapon with strong suppression capability. Generally used as a close-range defensive weapon for Arbalétrier Autonomous Combat Units.,,,,
HWI_Thunder,WEAPON,"Launches a missile that splits into eight singularity warheads on closing with the target, maximizing strike effectiveness.",,,,
HWI_gauss,WEAPON,A long-range weapon designed to overload the target's shields. The heavy kinetic slug it fires is also effective against all but the heaviest armor.,,,,
HWI_amblaster,WEAPON,"A slow-firing, extremely high damage energy gun widely used by Tri-Tachyon and its affiliates that has been extensively combat tested. Acknowledging its immense power, Weapons Industry has included the Antimatter Blaster into its modification framework and developed larger weapons based on the same principles.",,,,
HWI_hveldriver,WEAPON,Specialized weapon designed to overload and disable enemy ship systems at long range. The high-speed uranium alloy nuggets fired are also effective against shields.,,,,
HWI_lightdualac,WEAPON,"A light weapon, effective at close range, is a favorite among captains who either lack the requirements to maintain needlers or are fond of charging into battle. The Weapons Industry made minimal modifications — as there was simply nothing to improve.",,,,
HWI_heavymauler,WEAPON,An advanced weapon system designed to punch through armor plating at long-range. Has a low sustained rate of fire but high per-burst damage.,,,,
HWI_Thunder_S,WEAPON,"Launches a missile that splits into eight singularity warheads on closing with the target. The interference between the warheads hinders accuracy, but ironically enhances their disabling effects.",,,,
HWI_Thunder_M,WEAPON,"A launcher loaded with several Thunder MIRVs. Its lightweight design limits the amount of available ammo but makes it suitable for installation on smaller ships. Thanks to the Thunder MIRV's immense destructive power, even the most ammo conscious captains rarely criticize its design concept.",,,,
HWI_TingYu_M,WEAPON,"A slow, heavy torpedo designed for use against large threats, equipped with a containment-based warhead that detonates violently upon field collapse. To overcome the strong interference the field causes to traditional guidance systems. The Weapons Industry adopted a gravimetric self-guidance mechanism, enabling the torpedo to perform limited trajectory adjustments towards the strongest gravitational signature nearby. Cloudburst's limited maneuverability and narrow seeker arc minimize the risk of it turning around and striking friendly vessels. Nonetheless, its long burn has lead to occasional incidents where the torpedo circles a significant portion of the battlefield before hitting allies.",,,,
HSI_Dancer_RA,WEAPON,"A balanced plasma weapon with a high rate of fire. The unstable plasma projectiles shatter upon impact, severely disrupting surrounding energy conduits and communication signals. It can be loaded with different types of ion excitation cores to produce plasma with different characteristics, resulting in combat behavior similar to more conventional light weapons.",,,,
HWI_UGB_S,WEAPON,A multi-purpose inertial bomb. The cheapest and oldest unguided weapon.,,,,
HWI_Roamer,WEAPON,"A rapid-fire autocannon that launches micro-cavitating rounds, incorporated into combat systems for its effectiveness in swiftly breaking through various forms of defense. Independent capacitors allow both barrels to unleash simultaneous bursts of fire, but require a cooldown period is to recharge between bursts.",,,,
HWI_Liebe,WEAPON,"A massive weapon system dubbed a gigantic railgun, it dwarfs most conventional armaments. It fires ultra-high-velocity projectiles that strike with such speed, they are often mistaken for beams. Prior to firing, its capacitors can be overcharged to further increase the power of the projectile. The ""Liebe"" is based on a modified turbo cannon, but the railgun technology by which it accelerates its energy projectile remains undisclosed by the Department of Science and Technology.",,,,
HWI_HuoShu,WEAPON,"A derivative missile system developed after the success of the ""Duality"". It features a similar micro-forge design as the Duality, allowing it to continuously replenish anti-fighter missiles even when not installed on dedicated missile slots. Due to space and safety considerations, the missiles by the Blazewood are far less powerful than those fired by the Duality.",,,,
HWI_WingMan_Catapult,WEAPON,"Aside from sharing the same drone technology, Large Wingman bears almost no resemblance to ""Small Wingman"". Large Wingman is essentially a rapidly deployable drone production bay, capable of continuously manufacturing swarms of cheap, fragile drones to maintain pressure on hostiles. To fulfill its design goals, Large Wingman significantly compromises drone durability and AI capabilities, retaining only the most basic defenses. The drone swarm is only capable of attacking under central control, with an intelligence level that likely falls short of a true AI core.",,,,
HWI_TingYu_L,WEAPON,"A slow, heavy torpedo designed for use against large threats, equipped with a containment-based warhead that detonates violently upon field collapse. To overcome the strong interference the field causes to traditional guidance systems. The Weapons Industry adopted a gravimetric self-guidance mechanism, enabling the torpedo to perform limited trajectory adjustments towards the strongest gravitational signature nearby. Cloudburst's limited maneuverability and narrow seeker arc minimize the risk of it turning around and striking friendly vessels. Nonetheless, its long burn has lead to occasional incidents where the torpedo circles a significant portion of the battlefield before hitting allies.大型版本的""听雨""采用了三发连射的设计模式，为了避免受相互之间引力信号的影响，这种连射间隔十分漫长。",,,,
HWI_Tunnel,WEAPON,"Medium Wingman is the strangest member of the Wingman series, equipped with three dispatchable ion spear emitters that strike targets from the rear. Thanks to its low energy signature and small size, the drone is nearly impossible to hit. For small ships, this highly accurate and relentless weapon is devastating.",,,,
HWI_irautolance_Fighter,WEAPON,An efficient long-range beam weapon with high burst damage. The beam lacks sufficient focus to be effective against standard ship armor. Modifications by the Weapons Industry give it additional effects.,,,,
HWI_Kraken,WEAPON,"The recently introduced Kraken rocket was developed by the Third Design Bureau of the Weapons Industry, and continues their tradition of low-cost, general-purpose designs. The pod has excellent compatibility, allowing it to be mounted in any medium mount, though its additional functions can only be realized in missile slots. This cleverly utilizes the functions of missile slots without the addition of dead weight to the weapon. To compensate for suboptimal accuracy, the rockets are designed with proximity fuses to enhance hit probability.",,,,
HWI_ArcBlaster,WEAPON,"Although this weapon closely resembles the Mark IX in appearance, a thorough investigation by the engineering team revealed no connection between the two. The Arc Blaster applies a non-contact force to the target through unknown principles, causing severe damage to the shields while simultaneously pulling the target toward the source.",,,,

,,,,,,
HSI_Apostle_LA,WEAPON,"A superheated mass of plasma shaped into a sword through containment fields, the Beam Greatsword has superior cutting performance than the Apocalypse's Beam Blade due to higher temperatures. This weapon makes quick work of light targets, and can even cleave incoming missiles in half with help from a targeting computer.",,,,
HSI_Apostle_RA,WEAPON,"A heavy ion machine gun with firepower comparable to that of the Autopulse Laser. Due to limitations on size and power supply, this weapon requires significantly more intricate engineering than that of conventional large ship weapon systems, though this does not translate into any significant gains in actual combat effectiveness.",,,,
HSI_DayTimeMG,WEAPON,"Based on scarce technical documentation, this weapon's designation is White Night, and it serves as the sole armament of the Daylight Wing. During testing, the engineering team severely underestimated its power. The destroyer-grade armor plates they set up were quickly pierced by what appeared to be a rather diffuse particle stream of particles. It was then that they realized that the weapon's power was far less innocuous than it appeared.",,,,

#Ships#,,,,,,
HSI_Thor,SHIP,"A strike bomber equipped with a single Thunder MIRV missile. Its long engagement range and relatively high speed enables launch strikes from a relatively safe distance before retreating to its carrier with the help of barriers. Outfitted with a lightweight arc generator, it can deal devastating damage to enemy fighters attempting to intercept it.",,,,
HSI_Oath,SHIP,"The Oath-class was an early Council experiment in arming large ships with alien technology. The Oath-class demonstrated combat potential far beyond its predecessors in multiple operations, and was quickly mass produced to replace the aging Onslaught-class vessels. Designed primarily to hold and advance battle lines, the Oath-class boasts heavy armor and a large flux capacity, though this comes at the expense of reduced flux dissipation rate.

In its second major refit, the Oath-class was equipped with time coils. When activated, they provide the massive ship with a degree of tactical maneuverability for short periods of time. his experimental modification was soon standardized, becoming the most widely known model of the class today.

For a century following the Collapse, this widely deployed capital ship remained a mainstay of Halo Dynamics fleets. It was not until the deployment of the next generation Moonwind-class, MountainRain-class, as well as a small number of supercapital ships that the Oath-class was finally retired from its role as flagship in many fleets.",,,,
HSI_Apocalyse,SHIP,"The Apocalypse-class Heavy Autonomous Combat Unit was originally a heavy mech developed by the Weapons Industry for ground warfare. Armed with a heavy Gatling gun and protected by warship-grade armor, it dominates in ground battlefields — causing enemy soldiers to fall into dispair. The three thrusters fitted on the Apocalypse provide it with ample mobility in planetary raids and potential boarding operations, as well as enable it to enjoy limited maneuverability in space.

The Council determined that, with minor modifications, this mech could be produced directly from flight decks, eliminating the need for storage in cargo bays. The Weapons Industry later adapted the Apocalypse into an LPC capable of carrier operations, now commonly seen among patrol fleets. This powerful mech can crush rebel forces on the ground and inflict serious damage on small targets in space with minimal risk to personnel.

The greatest drawback may lie with the Hegemony's internal concerns about its level of artificial intelligence. However, given the benefit of militart aid and the looming presence of several battlefleets, no one dares to voice these concerns openly.",,,,
HSI_Apocalyse_G,SHIP,"An Apocalypse Enhanced Firepower Variant, internally codenamed ""Grenadier"". It is equipped with two triple barreled shoulder launchers capable of firing devastating canister explosives in a forward arc. Primarily used against vehicles and structures, it can also cause serious damage to entrenched enemies in ground combat. Due to the significant collateral damage it causes, this unit is only deployed in battles where fire restrictions are lifted. In addition, this modification displaces the Gatling gun, resulting in reduced long-range firepower. Many marines believe this has improved the unit's melee effectiveness, though internal reports from the Weapons Industry deny any correlation between their combat experience and the actual melee performance of the mech.",,,,
HSI_Citadel,SHIP,"The Citadel-class employs a variant of the Entanglement system — since the standard system could not support the Camelot fire platform it carries. By forgoing other features and retaining only the remote deployment and recovery modules, the Citadel is able to project the majority of its firepower anywhere on the battlefield. This allows it to secure objectives or provide anchors for the fleet, while continuing to control the battlefield with cruiser-like maneuverability. The Council classifies the Citadel-class as defensive battleships, to emphasize the formidable protection it receives from from dual shield generators and its otherwise limited offensive capabilities.",,,,
HSI_Promise,SHIP,"The Promise-class is the successor to the Dominator-class in Halo Dynamics fleets. As the heavy cruiser of the fleet, it maintains powerful shields and flux capacity while featuring heavier armor and stronger hull than standard Halo Dynamics ships. This comes at the cost of reduced maneuverability as a result of weaker thrusters. In fleets, the Promise is typically deployed alongside other ships to form a battle line, advancing deliberately to exploit breaches in enemy openings in enemy lines created by more maneuverable ships.",,,,
HSI_Spade,SHIP,"The Twilight-class is equipped with a spinal-mounted heavy cannon: Hammer of Humanity. As the Twilight is weakly armed otherwise, it is ill-suited for sustained firefights, and instead relies on the Hammer of Humanity and its tactical systems to deliver sudden bursts of damage, often leading to the target overloading or suffering critical damage. The Twilight's maneuverability grants it considerable survivability, though its fragile hull struggles to endure damage once its shields are down.",,,,
HSI_DengHuo,SHIP,"The Lamplight-class is a specialized cargo ship designed for dangerous environments. It is equipped with a new type of turret deployment system, ensuring it is not completely defenseless when facing pirates.",,,,
HSI_Elegy,SHIP,"The Elegy-class is extraordinarily expensive to produce. This support ship lacks conventional firepower but carries specialized equipment capable of disrupting the subsystems of enemy vessels, effectively crippling them. To compensate for its limited offensive capabilities, it is equipped with the still-classified Spirit system, allowing it to hold its ground even during sieges while mysteriously amplifying the damage inflicted on its targets in an almost mystical way.",,,,
HSI_ZhiYuan,SHIP,"The Papercut-class excels at countering small ships and is equipped with the Phenomenon electromagnetic cloud emitter. In addition, it features a unique Drift System that enables it to perform temporary tactical maneuvers by harnessing overflow energy from Phenomenon's electromagnetic clouds.",,,,
HSI_T_01_68,SHIP,"Butterfly-class. Every L Department ship is personally overseen by the Director, and no secrets within are known outside the department. This sophisticated and elegant ship possesses the capability to threaten even the largest targets within the sector.",,,,
HSI_TianGuang,SHIP,"The Skylight-class possesses terrifying firepower disproportionate to its size. This temporal assault ship trades extremely high maintenance requirements for astonishing combat power, and is especially adept at hunting down small enemy targets.",,,,
HSI_Comet,SHIP,"The Comet-class serves as auxiliary frigates within Halo Dynamics fleets. These heavily armed escorts not only assist larger friendly ships in holding battle lines but can also engage large ships when necessary.

Prior to the introduction of the Skylight and Mist-classes into service, Halo Dynamics had a significant gap in its small ship lineup, relying solely on outdated Domain designs and the Comet to fill the role of frigates.",,,,
HSI_Maid,SHIP,"The Maid Wing serves as light support units. These small drones are typically used to supplement the defenses of larger warships, with their only notable advantage being their low cost.",,,,
HSI_Maid_S,SHIP,"After a thorough analysis of the tactical requirements, the Weapons Industry proposed a modification to the Maid Wing. This light delivery platform has atmospheric entry capability, and if equipped with inexpensive inertial munitions, may be used to bomb targets when orbital bombardment is too costly. Thus, the Maid-S was born. This simple drone can be rapidly produced and replaced, and can serve as a cheap alternative to traditional fuel bombing during long- distance patrols.",,,,
HSI_FengYue,SHIP,"A massive attack carrier, capable of carrying far more fighters than any ship in Domain naval history. In addition to enormous hangars and nanoforges, the Moonwind-class also comes with an advanced wing management system to coordinate its vast fighter complement. Multiple temporal manipulation modules are installed within the hull, allowing selective acceleration of hangar production facilities, weapon systems, or wings, further enhancing the Moonwind-class' combat efficiency. Since its launch, the Moonwind-class has served as the backbone of carrier task forces, actively operating as flagships within the few carrier divisions among Halo Dynamics fleets.",,,,
HSI_Camelot,SHIP,"A heavy fire platform equipped with capital ship level firepower. The double shield design makes the Camelot nigh impregnable. Due to its compact size, it can only be equipped with cruiser class auxiliary subsystems.",,,,
HSI_Vision,SHIP,"An assault ship originally conceived during the Domain era, the Vision-class is a product of the ""Cruiser School"" naval revolution. It is designed with the goal of projecting supporting missile fire near enemy defensive zones — or to spearhead the delivery of devastating strikes. With this in mind, the entire forward section of the Vision-class is dedicated to missile storage and production, sacrificing conventional frontal firepower in exchange for strong missile capability and endurance. Prior to the Fifty-Year War, as tensions with Tri- Tachyon escalated, the Council deemed that war was increasingly imminent. Many older warships had their designs overhauled, and the Vision-class was among them. The modern Vision-class now comes equipped with advanced shield generators and torpedo autoforges.",,,,
HSI_Weaver,SHIP,"The Weaver-class is a light torpedo ship. Though a little large, its powerful engines and fragile hull make it far more agile than it appears. Integrated production facilities allow the Weaver to sustain continuous torpedo strikes.",,,,
HSI_ShanYu,SHIP,"The MountainRain-class is classified as a cruiser by the Ship Industry, but capital-grade subsystems have led other powers to dispute this designation. This also means the MountainRain more capable than it appears. Its versatile weapon configurations, combined with high maneuverability allow the MountainRain to easily handle numerous smaller enemies. However, its defenses are weak, and its firepower weak for a capital ship, making the MountainRain ill-suited for the front lines.

A product of the ""large cruiser"" project, the MountainRain-class is larger than any Domain Era cruiser — but slightly smaller than a traditional battlecruiser. Using its onboard Time Flow system, the MountainRain can transfer itself into an alternate timeline, while projecting firepower back to the original one. Early experiments revealed that this system severely disrupts the time flow of both onboard precision equipment and crew on board, prompting the development of spacetime stabilization anchors. Subsequent research showed that these disturbances increase dramatically with the size of the object that left the timeline, so smaller models did not need to be equipped with such devices.",,,,
HSI_Qiming,SHIP,"The Morningstar-class is a light carrier, usually used as an escort. With balanced armament and an IFF disruptor, it boasts exceptional lethality against light targets.",,,,
HSI_Xianfeng,SHIP,"The Northwind-class was developed late in the Fifty-Year War, serving as flagship and aviation support ship for medium-sized fleets. Compared to older carriers, the Northwind-class has a more carefully optimized weapons layout, and can exert firepower close to that of a light cruiser with fewer armaments. In addition, its design prioritized survivability against missile threats, integrating the then-renowed Counter point-defense system.",,,,
HSI_YunYan,SHIP,"The Mist-class premier heavy frigate, was developed during a period of escalating tensions with Tri-Tachyon to combat the smaller ships during the expansion phase. Its formidable armament ensures it can hold its own even against dedicated gunboats.",,,,
HSI_Mayfly,SHIP,A dedicated point-defense support fighter that provides all-around point defense at medium to short range. Ineffective against other types of enemies.,,,,
HSI_Flanker,SHIP,"A fighter designed for space-superiority, this cutting-edge interceptor is armed with powerful but limited heavy anti-fighter weaponry. It will return for resupply once out of ammo. This aspect of the Flanker resembles a bomber.",,,,
HSI_Conquest,SHIP,"The Overlord-class is a comprehensive modernization of the aging Conquest-class. It features heavier armor, a new barrier system, and a complete firepower overhaul.

Its predecessor, the Super Conquest-class, was originally commissioned by Tri-Tachyon as a retrofit with high-grade shield generators and heavier armor to counter the growing threat of carriers. Following the Sagittarian Civil War, the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation aligned itself with Halo Dynamics. And the Super Conquest was added to Halo Dynamics fleets. Prior to the Fifty-Year War, plans to modernize these aging vessels were set in motion, and the final model was named the Overlord-class.

The dynamics of war in this new era are very different from the past, the tacticians of old never imagined the day when the shields would lag behind spears — yet that day has come. In the face of overwhelming firepower, it seems only even greater firepower can prevail.

HSI_Eagle,SHIP,"The Golden Eagle-class serves as a maneuverable long-range fire platform. Its retrofit with barrier systems did not affect its tactical role much, and thanks to its impeccable structural design and weapon configuration, the Golden Eagle-class can be said to have undergone the smallest changes from Ship Industry modification.",,,,
HSI_Aurora,SHIP,"After energy barriers became battlefield-ready, the Aurora-class was quickly added to the retrofit list. The modernized variant, redesignated as the Planet-class, retained the Aurora's iconic asymmetrical design. While many captains argue that this retrofit actually diminished the Planet-class' burst firepower. However, it is still well armed and very effective in battle.",,,,
HSI_Sunder,SHIP,"A high firepower destroyer. The Peregrine-class is based on the Sunder-class, which was redesigned from the gound up and added to Halo Dynamics fleets under a new name. The Peregrine retains the weapons layout and High Energy Focus system of the Sunder, with only a few structural changes.",,,,
HSI_Medusa,SHIP,"An advanced destroyer based on the Medusa-class. While it retains most of the Medusa-class's original core systems, including the Phase Skimmer and near identical weapons layout, the ColdRain-class differs greatly in hull structure, whixh was altered to optimize internal space feed up by the replacement of the shield generator.",,,,
HSI_Shrike,SHIP,"This cutting-edge light destroyer shares the same base design as the renowed Shrike-class. The propulsion system of the WoodOwl was adapted for Plasma Jets instead of the predecessor's Plasma Burn, giving the light destroyer greater tactical initiative.",,,,
HSI_Wolf,SHIP,"The Mallet-class is a variant of the Brawler-class, used as a small torpedo ship. Its rudimentary fire control system cannot support precision guided munitions and its frame is unable to support large autoloaders or nanoforges. In most engagements, the Mallet's objective is to unload its torpedo payload and retreat from the battlefield.",,,,
HSI_Scarab,SHIP,"More discerning captains will quickly recognize the similarities between the Longwind and Scarab-class ships. Despite appearing completely different, their weapon loadouts bear striking similarities. The Longwind-class retains a Domain era Temporal Shell system. Compared to the time manipulation system developed by Halo Dynamics, it is superior in speed of time flow, but this comes at the cost of marginally reduced firepower.",,,,

HSI_Life,SHIP,"The Ephemeral-class dreadnought, developed by Halo Dynamics in the middle of the Fifty-Year War, is a supercapital designed to counter the growing threat of Tri-Tachyon Capital fleet clusters. Its purpose is to spearhead a thrust through the heart of enemy formations when capital ships and their escorts vessels are occupied by piercing through enemy lines with overwhelming firepower.

The dreadnought is equipped with a propulsion system that can be overcharged for short periods of time, an Entrophy Feedback System, and a 4th-gen Time Space Manipulation system that allows it to unleash devastating firepower in the heat of battle despite its unexceptional number of armaments. Like most Halo Dynamics warships, the Ephemeral-class is designed with state-of-the-art technology. However, its reliability drew skepticism from the Department of War, who questioned the use of cryogenic energy conduits throughout the ship, a technology that had not yet undergone comprehensive large-scale production testing during the design phase.

As the first class of dreadnought, the Ephemeral-class was criticized by many military officials for its exorbitant development and construction costs. Fortunately however, it achieved dazzling results in the several battles it participated in. With the defeat of Tri-Tachyon and the abrupt end of the war, much of the original fleet production plans were halted or postponed, and the Ephemeral, now out of production, became a monument in the hands of fleets that survived the great war.",,,,
HSI_UkiyoA,SHIP,"The Department of War anticipated the discontinuation of the Ephemeral-class: It was unlikely that the Council would allow the continued production of such expensive ships after the war. And with the Oath-class reaching the end of its upgrade potential, a new capital ship to fill the void was urgently reqiored. Ship Industry developed the Ukiyo-class dreadnought to meet the Department of War's specifications of versatility, economy, and sophistication to establish it as the backbone of a new generation of fleets.

The design of the hull of the Ukiyo-class is based on that of the Ephemeral-class, retaining its signature tapered stern and OverDrive system. Modifications were mainly focused on the forward section. The Ukiyo-class can be quickly reconfigured at any standard dock to meet to different tactical requirements, and is designed with fleet-wide auxiliary systems. Assault Mode focuses on electronic warfare and firepower, with an advanced fire control center and an electronic warfare system capable of blanketing the entire battlefield. This ensures uninterrrupted information flows from allies under all known situations, allowing for accurate coordination of fleet firepower.

Compared to its predecessor, the Ephemeral-class, the Ukiyo-class appears rather mediocre. This dreadnought, which yet to demonstrate its capabilities, still has a long path head.

HSI_Oath_GF3,SHIP,"An elite model upgraded with a new barrier generator, reserved solely for the Guards Fleet, and further tailored to the fleet's tactical doctrine.

The Oath-class was an early Council experiment in arming large ships with alien technology. The Oath-class demonstrated combat potential far beyond its predecessors in multiple operations, and was quickly mass produced to replace the aging Offense-class vessels. Designed primarily to hold and advance battle lines, the Oath-class boasts heavy armor and a large flux capacity, though this comes at the expense of reduced flux dissipation rate.

In its second major refit, the Oath-class was equipped with time coils. When activated, they provide the massive ship with a degree of tactical maneuverability for short periods of time. his experimental modification was soon standardized, becoming the most widely known model of the class today.

For a century following the Collapse, this widely deployed capital ship remained a mainstay of Halo Dynamics fleets. It was not until the deployment of the next generation Moonwind-class, MountainRain-class, as well as a small number of supercapital ships that the Oath-class was finally retired from its role as flagship in many fleets.",,,,

HSI,FACTION,"Halo Dynamics, formerly known as the Domain Alien Technology Research Institute, gradually evolved into its current complex political entity following the Collapse. Its earliest established division was the Halo Dynamics Ship Industry, which remains its most commonly used public-facing identity. The corporation now encompasses over a dozen departments, including the Weapons Industry, Science and Technology, Security, War, Interior, and Finance, effectively functioning as a megacorporation that dominates the Sagittarian Sector.

The organization is governed by a Council, with leadership centered around its Director, who was the former head of the research institute. While council members have undergone multiple rotations over time, the Director has never changed. Due to the unshakeable authority of the Director, Halo Dynamics still retains a significant degree of loyalty to the Domain. Councilors who attempt to challenge this either quickly come around or disappear.

Following the Signal Suppression War and the Omega Nebula Incident, nearly all local factions within the Sagittarian Sector became subordinate to either Halo Dynamics or Tri-Tachyon. Due to historical tensions dating back to the Domain era, friction between the two sides gradually intensified, eventually erupting into a sector-wide civil war spanning five decades. The conflict ended in victory for Halo Dynamics and the acquisition of most Tri-Tachyon assets. Prior to the end of the war, the Sagittarian branch of Tri-Tachyon sent several encrypted communications to the Persean Sector. The Department of Security assessed that these transmissions may have contained intelligence on the Gates, and consequently, the Council ordered of the near-complete EHOF Project be restarted, culminating in Halo Dynamics' arrival in the war-torn Persean Sector at the height of the Second AI War.
