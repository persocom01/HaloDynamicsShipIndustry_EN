Location: Near the heart of the Delta Kerm system
Date: 181.6.9, 49 minutes after the 1st Guards Fleet forced their way though the pulsar beam.

Both sides had committed hundreds of larger ships and thousands of screening vessels across the four systems of the Kerm Constellation. As battle lines continued to converge, Tri-Tachyon decided to withdraw the majority of their fleet deeper into corporate space. Hoping to draw out the conflict until Halo Dynamics was forced to negotiate for peace.

Over the course of a long week, Tri-Tachyon fleets began converging on the outskirts of the Delta Kerm system. Halo Dynamics' fleets followed closely behind, gradually closing the noose around Tri-Tachyon. The reason why Tri-Tachyon chose Delta Kerm was simple: they intended to use the system’s pulsar beams to throw off Halo Dynamics' lead fleets, buying time for their main force to retreat safely.

The plan would have been a success — had the 1st Guards Fleet not forced their way through the pulsar beam and caught the Tri-Tachyon fleets by the tail. Caught tightly in the jaws of their pursuers, Tri-Tachyon's rearmost fleet found themselves unable to disengage and were forced to turn and fight. At this moment, Tri-Tachyon's executive officer took a gamble: he ordered half of the fleets to remain and cover the rear, hoping to wipe out the pursuers entirely. If successful, Halo Dynamics' morale and military strength would be dealt severe blow.

Isolated and helpless, the 1st Guards' desperate struggle for survival begins.
