Location: Near Hegemony contolled space

The first raid seriously disrupted Tri-Tachyon's deployments, forcing their already stretched raid team to return to deal with more agile harassers. The detachment tied down a significant portion of Tri-Tachyon's fighting force at minimal cost, and all successfully withdrew toward the Persean League or the fringes of the Sector undetected. Soon after, Tri-Tachyon was forced to face the Hegemony in direct engagement along the front lines. While the main fleets on both sides held each other at bay, Tri-Tachyon sent raiding parties to Intrusion. However, heavy losses and the 2nd Guards Fleet stationed at the Space Bridge forced them to abort the operation and instead turn to attempting to disrupt Halo Dynamics' supply lines to neighbouring Hegemony star systems.

The deadlock between the two sides persisted for months, with Halo Dynamics fielding larger and larger escorts to secure supply lines and Tri-Tachyon finding raids increasingly difficult as a result. So when Commander Olympous found a transport escorted by only a single cruiser and several destroyers, he was overjoyed. Despite repeated warnings from his tactical officer that the specifications of the cruiser were unknown, he decided to take the risk.

Entering battle, he realizes that the so-called 'cruiser' is equipped with capital ship systems and firepower, along with technology never before seen by Tri-Tachyon.
