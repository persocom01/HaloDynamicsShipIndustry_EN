""However, Councilor Borodinov is certain to inform the Expeditionary Force of my disappearance, and there's no way to reach him without revealing ourselves. Once the news gets out, the 3rd Fleet will take immediate action, and the moment they emerge from the wormhole, the entire Persean Sector will be put on edge.""

""Should that occur, we won't be the only who will be losing sleep. That is why —"" She let her voice stretch,

""The fate of the Persean Sector is in your hands, my dear a-sis-tant.""

You start to devise a plan.

""Lucily for us, it's also a two seater, yet only requires a single operator. The original plan was to retrieve it through other means, but the operation was paused due to the peace talks, just as we happen to need it.""

Given the circumstances, the odds of breaching the blockade and arriving within communication range of the Halo Dynamics Fleet are practically zero. You stick to the course plotted by the onboard computer, trying to push past the blockade.

You hear the Director fiddling with her panel. Suddenly, the route on the HUD changes, pointing you to a vacant spot above the planet. Without allies or cover, it wouldn't occur to anyone as an escape route.","HSI_TTMission_AfterBattle_0:Pose questions

The tension breaks as the strain from the neural link quickly fades. With your pursuers closing in, you inexplicably begin to slow down. You fix your eyes on the radar, flooded with signals.

The Director walks over to the massive bookshelf in her office. You watch as she idly runs her fingers along the book spines, as though browsing through a collection of history books. You lack the historical knowledge to recognize the entities written on the spines, such as the ""Earth United Council"" or the ""Sindari Federation"".

She tapped a few times on her Tripad, then turned her attention to the trinkets on the table, as if searching for something to give you. You're not particularly eager to add your collection of trinkets, especially with objects of unknown origin and purpose and yet are clearly not just decorative.

Fortunately, she quickly abandoned the idea, ""Head to the dock, Captain $playerName.""",cutCommLink:Head to the dock,
